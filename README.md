# Darwin Editor

Darwin Editor is a comprehensive tool designed for creating and editing Bibite templates. This editor provides a user-friendly interface for managing various aspects of Bibites, including nodes, synapses, and genes.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop File Upload**: Easily upload Bibite templates by dragging and dropping files into the designated area.
- **Form-Based Input**: Fill out forms to specify Bibite details such as name, species name, description, and version.
- **Node Management**: Add, edit, and remove hidden nodes and output nodes with ease.
- **Synapse Management**: Create and configure synapses between nodes.
- **Gene Configuration**: Adjust gene values using sliders and input fields.
- **Preview**: Visualize your Bibite with a real-time preview canvas.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for a comfortable editing experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

    cd darwin-editor
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start using the editor.

## Usage

### Creating a New Bibite Template
1. **Enter Bibite Details**: Fill out the form fields to specify the Bibite's name, species name, description, and version.
2. **Add Nodes and Synapses**: Click the "Add Node" button to create hidden nodes and output nodes. Connect nodes using synapses.
3. **Configure Genes**: Use the sliders to set gene values.
4. **Preview**: View the real-time preview of your Bibite on the canvas.
5. **Save**: Click the generate button to download the newly created Bibite template.

### Editing an Existing Bibite Template
1. **Upload a Bibite Template**: Use the file input or drag and drop a `.bb8template` file into the upload area.
2. **Edit Bibite Details**: Fill out the form fields to specify the Bibite's name, species name, description, and version.
3. **Manage Nodes and Synapses**: Add or remove nodes and synapses as needed. Configure their properties using the provided input fields and sliders.
4. **Adjust Genes**: Use the sliders to set gene values.
5. **Preview**: View the real-time preview of your Bibite on the canvas.
6. **Save**: Click the generate button to download the edited Bibite template.

## Roadmap

- Graphical preview of the genes.
- Graphical preview of the neural network structure.
- Graphical editor for the neural network structure.
